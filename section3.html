         <h3><strong>A Brief History of The Battle of the Atlantic and Convoy System</strong></h3>
         <p class="centered-paragraph"> The Battle of the Atlantic was the single longest campaign of the war, lasting from September 3rd 
            1939 to May 8th 1945. Often overlooked in its importance, this naval campaign keep the Atlantic corridor open, connecting the 
            Americas with Europe and North Africa. A life line of lend-lease aid which supplemented the war torn economies of the United Kingdom
            France, the Soviet Union, and other countries. If Germany was capable of controlling the Atlantic sea lanes, they could sever this 
            connection and threaten the Allies's ability to contain waging war. Such was the importance of the battle, Churchill considered it 
            “The only thing that ever really frightened [him] during the war was the U-boat peril” (Churchill 1949, 529). Had Germany's U-boats
            taken control of the seas, Hitler would have starved Britain into submission, bleed the Soviet Union dry of raw materials and 
            supplemental goods, and thwarted any hopes an Allied invasion onto mainland Europe. Thus was the importance of convoys in ensuring
            troops and goods made it safely across the ocean. 

            As the battle spanned the length of the whole war, it can be broken down into seven periods. Each of which is characterized by 
            the location of focus, deployment of new tactics, and the overall effectiveness of the U-boats. <br><br>

            <strong>Period I (September 1939 - May 1940):</strong> This period of World War Two is often referred to the "Phoney War" for the
            lack of Allied military engagements which is again reflected in the Atlantic. The limited number of German U-boats, based in Germany,
            operated only around the British Isles. Additionally, it would not be until December 1939 and War Order No. 154 that Germany would
            engage in unrestricted submarine warfare. Much of the earlier focus on the German side was mine laying, often which done by U-boats.
            For the Royal Navy, their initial focus was enforcing a naval blockade over Germany and reviving the convoy system from WWI. Limited 
            offensive measures were taken by the Royal Navy against U-boats during this period. The U-boats small silhouette and a lack of 
            effective weapons and tactics left the U-boats relatively free from attacks. U-boats that did attack ships focused on independent 
            merchant ships during day time attacks. During these initial engagements and the concurrent Norwegian Campaign, flaws were identified
            in U-boat torpedoes and tactics. Furthermore, the full strength strategy that was present in the very beginning of the war was 
            unsustainable and U-boat production not viewed as a priority by Nazi leadership.  <br><br>
            
            <strong>Period II (June 1940 - March 1941):</strong> With the fall of France in June, the Battle of the Atlantic entered a new phase.
            Gone was the French Navy, the fourth largest in the world and forced the Royal Navy to stretch its force even thinner. Construction
            of U-boat bases in France began, reducing the travel to the Atlantic from German bases in the North Sea by about 450 miles (U-boats were 
            forced to travel around the British Isles instead of the Britain Channel). The fall of Western Europe also meant the full U-boat force
            could be direct against the United Kingdom and the royal Navy. This era became known as the "Happy Time" to U-boat crews as they faced 
            relatively uncontested success. The main location of attacks was the western approach to Great Britain. U-boat tactics also evolved seeing 
            crews spread out to cover this vast approach to better spot convoys and independent ships. Once a target was spotted, other U-boats were
            notified and assembled into packs to attack often now at night. What would become known as "wolf packs" groups of U-boats attacking proved extremely deadly
            as the Royal Navy and merchant shipping suffered some its worst losses in September and October 1940. In addition to the U-boats, German 
            Luftwaffe planes operating from France and Kriegsmarine coastal raiders continued to threaten shipping.
