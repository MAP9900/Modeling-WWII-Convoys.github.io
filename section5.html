        <h3><strong> This section outlines the sources, research, and other factors that went into the project:</strong></h3>
        <p class="centered-paragraph">
            <strong>Source for the Convoy Data:</strong> All data pertaining to the specific convoys comes from Arnold Hague Convoy Database 
            which can be found <a href="http://www.convoyweb.org.uk/hague/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>. A naval historian, Hague collected
            and recorded convoy data in collaboration with John K. Burgess and Don Kindell. The Hague Convoy Database is the most complete available
            record of WWII convoys and includes many records missing from the National Archives. The specific convoy data relevant 
            to this project was web-scraped from the website using the code found on my <a href="https://github.com/MAP9900/Modeling-The-Convoy-System/tree/main/Code/Web%20Scrape%20Files
            "target="_blank">Github</a>. Currently, the convoy routes examined are HX, SC, OB, ON, and ONS. An outline of these routes is provided 
            further down this page. <br><br>
            <strong>Validation of the Convoy Data:</strong> The convoy data in the Hague Convoy Database is recorded at the ship level noting ships
            sunk sometimes noting buy a specific U-Boat or another reason. My code looks for "sunk" or "sank" in counting instances of sinkings and thus counts
            all cases of sinking regardless if they occurred because of German U-Boat or not. Therefore, a secondary source was used to validate
            ships marked as sunk. To do this, I compared the Hague Convoy Database to data on U-Boat Net which can be found 
            <a href="https://uboat.net/ops/convoys/convoys.php?convoy=ON-134#google_vignette" target="_blank">here</a>. U-Boat Net contains records
            on all German U-Boats including allied merchant and war ships sunk by the U-Boats. The number of ships sunk by U-Boat by each specific 
            convoy (<a href="https://uboat.net/ops/convoys/convoys.php?convoy=ON-134" target="_blank">Link</a>) was web-scraped. This data was then
            compared to the Hague Convoy Database noting convoys with an inconsistent number of sinkings. Inconsistent convoys were then checked manually 
            to identify ships not sunk by U-Boat or other anomalies. Ships sunk by other reasons were removed from the sink count but remained in the data.
            The total number of ships variable is determined from when the convoy departs and thus the inclusion of these ships has no affect towards this. 
            Although, it is worth noting the convoys changes size while en route due these other sinkings, U-Boat sinkings, ships which straggle behind, return 
            to port, or other reasons. The true size of each convoy, therefore, is dynamic and changes as the convoy sails. However, this is not able to be 
            captured and it is assumed convoy size is consistent in the research. <br><br>
            <strong>The Number of U-Boats at Sea Data:</strong> An additional feature added to help refine the models and classification was the estimated
            number of U-Boats in the North Atlantic by month data. This data comes from a May 23, 1945  British report and can be found 
            <a href="https://www.churchillarchive.com/catalogue-item?docid=CHAR20_238_2" target="_blank">here</a>. It is worth noting this for both 
            German & Italian U-Boats and therefore is higher than the true number of just German U-Boats. However, the number of ocean going Italian 
            U-Boats is limited and is assumed to be negligible for the purpose of this research. <br><br></p>

            <h3><strong> Outline of the Current Convoy Routes Examined:</strong></h3>
            <strong>HX:</strong> Eastward travel from Halifax, Nova Scotia to Liverpool, England. Active from September 1939 to the end of the War. Note:
            After September 1942, convoys departed from New York City, New York. <br>
            <strong>SC:</strong> Eastward travel from Sydney, Nova Scotia to the UK. Active from August 1940 until May 1945. Note: Departure port switched later to 
            Halifax or New York depending on the season. <br>
            <strong>OB:</strong> Westward from Liverpool, England dispersing 750 miles west of North America to various ports. Active from September 1939 
            to July 1941. Replaced by the OS & ON series. Note: As OB convoys dispersed, this makes their inclusion in the research debatable. <br>
            <strong>ON:</strong> Westward from Liverpool, England to dispersing 750 miles west of North America to various ports until March 1942 where 
            the convoy remained until arriving in ports in Canada and America. Active from July 1941 to May 1945. Note: Southend-on-Sea, England added
            as departure port in October 1944 and would meet at sea with ships from Liverpool. Additionally, same debate as convoys dispersed. <br> 
            <strong>ONS:</strong> Westward from Liverpool, England to Halifax, Nova Scotia. Active from March 1943 until June 1945. Note: Carried 
            slower vessels and was suspended from March to September 1944 because of the Normandy landings.
